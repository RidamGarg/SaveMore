What's this project about?

It is an e-commerce web app where users can buy prodcts. Users can see all the products listed by our sellers on the products page and add them to their cart.
Each user has the option to become a seller. After becoming a seller, he/she can add products to our database, which will then be immediately listed on our products page. 
In addition to information about the product, a seller can also add multiple images for describing the product.
